  # dblitz ships an in-app updater (Tauri, minisign-signed payloads), so the
  # installed .app can be a newer version than this cask's `version`. Without
  # this, brew and the updater fight: `brew upgrade` reinstalls the cask version
  # over a self-updated app, and `brew outdated` reports dblitz as outdated
  # forever because the on-disk version never matches.

  # dblitz stores its config under the app NAME, not the bundle identifier:
  # `dirs::config_dir()` + "dblitz" (see src-tauri/src/config.rs). The
  # bundle-id path this used to list has never existed, so `--zap` left
  # app.json and every per-database view config behind. The Preferences and
  # Saved Application State paths below are genuinely bundle-id-keyed —
  # macOS writes those itself — so they stay as they are.
